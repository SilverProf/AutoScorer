# AutoScorer
Small auto-scorer project to demonstrate the _process function.

In this project, I've set up a simple label meant to show the player's score. The payer should score 1 point automatically every second. However, I don't have the code set up to do that. That's your job.

MAIN TASK:
    Update the _process fucntion to give the player 1 point every second.

BONUS TASK #001:
    Increase the player's score increase as time progresses. (ie. 1 point per second for the first 10 seconds, then 2 points per second for the next 10 seconds, then 3 points per second, and so on and so forth)
